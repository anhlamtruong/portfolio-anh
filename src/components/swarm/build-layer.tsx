/**
 * BuildLayer: agent-swarm "build the page" animation. Loaded lazily by
 * SwarmRoot (next/dynamic, ssr: false), so it never blocks first paint.
 * It plays for every visitor (including reduced-motion systems, by the site
 * owner's choice); the HUD always offers Skip, and ?build=off disables it.
 *
 * DOM contract
 * - Section: [data-build-section="name"]. Optional data-build-start="load"
 *   (build right after the engine starts; gets the larger hero budget) and
 *   data-build-plan="text" (planner tag; default "plan · N tasks").
 *   Items belong to their nearest section; items outside any section are
 *   shown immediately.
 * - Item: [data-build-item][data-build="<kind>"]
 *     frame   container/card: outline dragged corner to corner, then fades in.
 *             data-build-tune: always open the inspector panel (radius /
 *             padding knobs, read from computed style). Some leaf cards get
 *             it automatically on desktop/tablet; never on phones.
 *     type    short text (< ~90 chars): typed behind a caret via clip-path
 *             (no DOM/layout changes; long text falls back to reveal).
 *             data-build-font: type in a mono draft (an aria-hidden clone in
 *             an overlay layer), pick the real font from a menu, cross-fade.
 *             A child in another family (e.g. a serif span) gets its own menu
 *             row. data-build-weight (with -font): afterwards font-weight
 *             sweeps 250 -> computed weight. Phones: only the page's first
 *             data-build-font item (kept items never swap).
 *             data-build-scale (type or reveal, not kept; desktop/tablet):
 *             appears small (scale 0.42, origin top-left) and offset, is
 *             resized to full size with a corner handle, then moved into
 *             place (readout like "↘ 36 px"); the inline transform is
 *             removed afterwards. Works with -font/-weight (the draft is
 *             scaled too); a color pick runs after. Phones skip it.
 *     reveal  text block/list: unmasked line by line.
 *     image   ghost card dragged in from the nearest viewport edge (or
 *             data-build-from="left|right|top|bottom") and dropped on the
 *             slot; uses the inner <img> as thumbnail, else a hatched
 *             placeholder with the alt/aria-label text. Kept images get the
 *             older outline + scan instead.
 *     dup     sibling inside a [data-build-list]; the list's first item is the
 *             master (mark it "frame"). Ghost copies fly from master to slot.
 *             In lists of 6+ items containing <img>, a few are dragged in
 *             individually as images. Phones: one sweep per list, and a
 *             master with no nested items joins it as the first slot.
 *   Any item: data-build-color="text|fill|stroke" -> after the item appears
 *   in a neutral color, a color wheel picks its real computed color (one per
 *   section on phones).
 *   Items nested inside another item wait for it. Optional:
 *   data-build-keep (never hidden, still annotated; ="mobile" only on the
 *   phone profile, below 768px), data-build-label (tag text),
 *   data-build-order="n", data-build-role="coder|designer|...".
 * - Grid: data-build-grid on the section element itself or on a container
 *   inside it (it may also be the data-build-list). Its direct element
 *   children are the cells. A layout agent (lime, layout·NN) draws dashed
 *   column/row lines from the cells' rects, then sweeps a hatched
 *   placeholder box over each cell row by row; the outermost items inside
 *   the grid wait for the lines, and each cell's placeholder fades once its
 *   items are built. The container itself is never hidden. Grids in no
 *   section are ignored.
 * - Hiding only applies under html[data-build="on"] (BuildFlagScript sets it
 *   before paint). Finished items and sections get [data-built].
 *
 * Grand-pass hooks (all optional)
 * - [data-swarm-spawn="planner|coder|designer|layout|tester|reviewer|deployer"]:
 *   mesh nodes in the hero (>= 1024 px). At boot/Replay they get [data-lit]
 *   one by one and agents pop out of a node of their role; [data-lit] is
 *   removed when the hero finishes. Hidden or zero-size nodes are ignored.
 * - [data-swarm-log] (data-swarm-log-lines="6"): static, server-rendered
 *   container whose children are swapped for live lines while building
 *   (p.swarm-log__line > span.swarm-log__who / __what / __t), with
 *   aria-hidden="true"; the fallback lines come back on Skip or unmount.
 * - [data-build-finale] section + [data-deploy-target][data-deploy-text]
 *   inside: after approval the deployer clicks the target, a deploy panel
 *   runs, then the target gets [data-deployed] (Skip jumps there).
 * - HUD "inspect" toggle (desktop, fine pointer, >= 1024 px, after the hero
 *   is built): hover or Tab to a built frame/image to see its real values.
 *   Esc turns it off. The overlay never takes pointer events.
 *
 * Crew: planner, coders, designers, layout (grids first, then card frames),
 * tester, deployer, reviewer; 15 on desktop, 11 on tablet, 8 on phones
 * (no deployer). Agents with nothing to do loop in place while anything
 * builds and for ~6 s after, then leave; the ticker stops once they are gone.
