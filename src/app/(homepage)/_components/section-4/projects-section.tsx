            <strong>The Omnifood project</strong> is a comprehensive landing
            page designed from the ground up for a modern food subscription
            service. The core challenge was to create a clean, trustworthy, and
            appealing interface that effectively converts visitors into
            customers. The entire design process was built on a systematic
            approach, starting with a well-defined design system.

                <strong>Systematic Layout:</strong> A consistent grid and

                the user&apos;s eye and improve readability.

              <li>
                <strong>User-Centric Component Design:</strong> Elements like
                buttons and forms were designed with clear visual cues and
                states (e.g., hover, focus) to create an intuitive and seamless
                user experience.

          <strong>The Forkify project</strong> is a modern recipe application
          that allows users to search, view, bookmark, and even upload their own
          recipes. The primary architectural goal was to build the application
          using the well-established **MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern**,
          ensuring a clear separation of concerns and creating a scalable and
          maintainable codebase from scratch.

            <li>
              <strong>MVC Architecture:</strong> The application is strictly
              organized with the Model for managing state and business logic
              (like API calls), the View for rendering the UI, and the
              Controller to act as the bridge between them.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Asynchronous Data Flow:</strong> All communication with
              the third-party recipe API is handled with `async/await` inside a
              reusable `AJAX` helper function, ensuring a smooth, non-blocking
              user experience while fetching data.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Reusable & Class-Based Views:</strong> A parent `View`
              class was implemented to contain shared rendering logic (like
              rendering spinners, errors, and messages), which other specific
              views inherit from, promoting code reusability and efficiency.

              based on user locale, and includes a session logout timer to
